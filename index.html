            <p>Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter
                Rive co-founded in 2006.[139] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems
                in the United States.[140] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production
                facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[141]
                Construction on the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture
                with Panasonic until early 2020 when Panasonic departed.</p>

                <p>SpaceX launched and successfully landed its futuristic Starship on Wednesday, finally nailing a test
                    flight of the rocketship that Elon Musk intends to use to land astronauts on the moon and send
                    people to Mars. The previous four test flights ended in fiery explosions before, during or soon
                    after touchdown at the south-eastern tip of Texas, near Brownsville. This latest upgraded version of
                    SpaceX’s full-scale, stainless steel, bullet-shaped rocketship soared more than six miles (10km)
                    over the Gulf of Mexico before flipping and descending horizontally, and then going vertical again
                    just in time for touchdown.</p>
